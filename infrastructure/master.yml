  This template deploys a VPC, with a pair of public and private subnets spread
  across two Availabilty Zones. It deploys an Internet Gateway, with a default
  route on the public subnets. It deploys a pair of NAT Gateways (one in each AZ),
  and default routes for them in the private subnets.

  It then deploys a highly available ECS cluster using an AutoScaling Group, with
  ECS hosts distributed across multiple Availability Zones.

  It also deploys a Jenkins instance used for building CI/CD pipelines.
